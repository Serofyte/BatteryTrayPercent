# BatteryTrayPercent
a simple java app i made to display battery % in the taskbar on windows 10

# dependencies
make sure java is installed. idk what min version you need, but i use jdk 25 so i know that one works

# how to make it work
1. download the whole repo. put folder where you want the app to be stored
2. put the BatteryTrayPercentStartup.bat file in your startup folder
3. edit that file to have the correct path to wherever you put the rest of the app
4. start that file, or restart pc
5. go to settings -> personalization -> taskbar -> small blue text that says
   "Select which icons appear on the taskbar"
   -> enable Java(TM) Platform SE Binary
